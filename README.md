Turns out, the other website was really hard to add anything onto due to styling inconsistencies and how I organized the CSS. Also, I wanted to try a different style.

## Things on this site
### A landing page! 
That's pretty important. Links to my github, youtube channel, and other pages on the site.

### Projects
As the title implies, it's a quick description and links to some projects I've worked on recently.

### Blog
Neglected ever since I built it, this was an attempt at formatting some pages for to use as my writing blog. Had to build a python script to reformat my wordpress posts into HTML, that was fun. Might just stick with wordpress, haha.

### Ikea
The web interface for my ikea stock/restock tracking tool. It works, I promise :^) Used it to get the Alex drawer which I use as the left leg(s) for my desk during the great Ikea Shortage of Summer '21.

### Photobook
Hey, pretty proud of this one. It's a self updating polaroid photo-wall themed for some of the pictures that I've taken and like. Check it out!
